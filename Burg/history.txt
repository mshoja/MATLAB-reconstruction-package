ARMASA version history
======================

0.1 / 20 November 2000 
----------------------

Beta-release of educational version

1.0 / 12 February 2001
----------------------

First official release

1.1 / 9 March 2001
------------------

Fixes:

- ARMA2COR(1,1,SHIFT) returned the zero-lag autocorrelation only. In
  addition to this element it now returns the correct number of SHIFT
  additional lags (that are all equal to zero).

1.2 / 5 April 2001
------------------

Fixes:

- ARMA2PSD(AR,MA,SAMPLE) returned incorrect values if the AR or MA
  process order was so great that 0.5*MAX(LENGTH(AR),LENGTH(MA))+1
  exceeded the number of PSD values requested by SAMPLE. This problem  
  was caused by the computation of an incomplete FFT, and has now 
  been corrected by the use of direct polynomial evaluation of the 
  PSD values at the requested frequencies.
- Help texts on ASAglob_subtr_mean, ASAglob_mean_adj and
  ASAglob_ar_cond are now available at the command prompt.

Modifications:

- The display of warning message ASA8 has been disabled. This message
  was showed if ARMASA main functions were called from other 
  functions without performing a version check. Instead, an
  explanation of the version control system will be provided when the
  function 'ASAaddpath' is invoked. This text also informs a user how
  to enable displaying of the ASA8 message.  

Additions:

- A function 'demo_armasa' has been added, showing some ARMASA toolbox
  features.

1.3 / 2 April 2003
------------------

Fixes:

- DEMO_ARMASA, SIG2ARMA and SIG2ARMA_E did not run properly in Matlab
  6.5, R13. A call to the modified WARNING function in R13, requesting
  an output argument, returns a structure instead of a character
  string. The mentioned ARMASA functions have been modified to work
  properly with R13 and previous releases.

1.4 / 12 July 2004
------------------

Modifications:

- 'demo_armasa' has been improved by correctly generating data.

Additions:

- arma2pred.m for predictions
- simuarma.m to generate data
- simple_demo.m 
- ARMASA info with list of ARMASA relevant literature


1.5 / 11 November 2004
----------------------
- release 7 of Matlab has problems with functions and variables with the 
  same name. In sig2ar.m the variable cic has been renamed cicar

- educational routines have been removed  


1.6 /  8 May 2006
