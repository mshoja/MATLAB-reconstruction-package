%Handling large data sets
%When working with datasets containing millions of data points, the computational burden 
%can be significant, leading us to consider using only a portion of the dataset. 
%However, selecting the appropriate portion is crucial, as opting for the first 10%, 
%last 10%, or middle portion can notably influence the final results, 
%potentially introducing bias into the estimated parameters. Since diffusion
%models are Markovian, we can employ mini-batch optimization, where we sample a fraction of
%‘data pairs’ and solve the underlying optimization problem based on that fraction alone. 
%Here, a 'data pair' refers to any consecutive pair (x_t,x_(t+1) ) across the data. 
%By randomly selecting a sample comprising just 10% of all data pairs, we can conduct
%the analysis on this subset. This fraction is well-mixed across the entire dataset 
%and provides a representative sample. To ensure an even more random selection
%compared to simple random sampling, we recommend and implement a ‘stratified’
%random sampling of data pairs. This method offers an excellent representation 
%of the entire dataset. After a random sample of data is obtained, we can follow 
%either of Euler or Hermite reconstruction as explained in previous sections.
%implementing both Euler and Hermite reconstructions.
