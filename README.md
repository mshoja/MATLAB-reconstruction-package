This repository contains a MATLAB package called the MATLAB Reconstruction Package. This package implements a maximum-likelihood estimation procedure to fit the following stochastic Langevin systems to univariate time series data with different resolutions (this process is known as 'system reconstruction'):

                                    dx = mu(x) dt + sigma(x) dW,
                                                                                                                                 
where mu(x) is the drift function, sigma(x) is the diffusion function, and ùëëùëä represents Brownian noise, which is uncorrelated and Gaussian. The package can reconstruct both high-resolution and low-resolution data. For high-resolution data, the Euler method (termed 'Euler reconstruction') is implemented,
while for low-resolution data, a more accurate methodology pioneered by A√Øt-Sahalia is implemented (termed 'Hermite reconstruction'). For details of both methods, please refer to the publication: A√Øt‚ÄêSahalia, Y. (2002). Maximum likelihood estimation of discretely sampled diffusions: a closed‚Äêform approximation approach. Econometrica, 70(1), 223-262.

This package supports two different reconstruction procedures: parametric reconstruction and spline reconstruction (for both low and high-resolution data).

Parametric Reconstruction: The user specifies a parametric model for the drift and diffusion functions (e.g., mu(x) = a*x^3-b*x^2, sigma(x) = c) and the package estimates the model parameters.
Spline Reconstruction: The user does not need to specify any model. Instead, a coarse mesh across the state space, called a 'knots sequence', should be specified. Spline modeling is more accurate, especially for Hermite reconstruction which
is used for low-resolution data, and is useful when choosing a model is challenging. 

This package includes:

A paper titled 'Reconstructing Langevin Systems from High and Low-Resolution Time Series using Euler and Hermite Reconstructions'
An appendix with solid mathematical descriptions
A user-friendly tutorial

Recommended Learning Strategy
Depending on your needs, follow these steps to learn how to use the package:

Quick Analysis:
Briefly review the paper, which contains five case studies (three simulated data sets and two real data sets from ecology and climate science). Execute the multi-section code 'AllFigures.m' to reproduce the examples in the paper. Then, use the codes for your own data.

Intermediate Learning:
Run the codes in the folder called 'Examples', which contains 10 case studies for various datasets.

In-Depth Learning:
Read the tutorial, which is explained in a user-friendly manner and includes 16 case studies for a range of simulated and real datasets.

Advanced Learning:
Study the appendix carefully for a more in-depth understanding of the mathematics, and refer to the references provided.
